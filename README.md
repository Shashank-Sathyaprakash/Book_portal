# Book Portal
I think we all might have faced this problem once in the student life that is finding the study material a day befor exam. In this year fullof pandamic all of the study was through online which has added to the problem. Keeping this in mind i have developed an app that can eas this problem. This app won third place in National level Mobile app developmenet competition organized by VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING.

## Features of the App
This app allows the students to share pdf material amongst the class.
   - The material is sorted based on the subject.
   - The material can be uploaded and downloaded by any student.
  
This also allows the students to sell their old books by posting the picture of the books in the app.
   - When a picture is posted, only a student of that corresponding department is notified.
   - The interested students can contact via the app and will redirect it to whatsapp or call.
  
The student will have the access to all the content pertaining to the syllabus.
