How many times have you struggled to find a particular note(pdf) from the whatsapp ? 
Amidst the pandemic there is a need for an efficient medium to share course materials such as notes of the syllabus among the students.
Last year I have created an Android application for which I had recieved the 3rd place in the National level Mobile app developmenet competition organized by VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING.
This app allows the students to share pdf material amongst the class.
   - The material is sorted based on the subject.
   - The material can be uploaded and downloaded by any student.
This also allows the students to sell their old books by posting the picture of the books in the app.
   - When a picture is posted, only a student of that corresponding department is notified.
   - The interested students can contact via the app and will redirect it to whatsapp or call.
The student will have the access to all the content pertaining to the syllabus.
