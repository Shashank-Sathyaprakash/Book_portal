# Book_portal
 I think we all might have faced this probem for once in the student life, struggel for finding the study material a day befor the exam. And at the time of the padamic as all of the studying was dependent online some of u might have face this problem much more frequently. Keeping this in mind I have developed an android app that can be usefull for sharing the study materials in one platform. This app won the third place in National level Mobile app developmenet competition organized by VIDYAVARDHAKA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING.
 
   ###   Features of the App
* The material is sorted based on the subject.

* The material can be uploaded and downloaded by any student. This also allows the students to sell their old books by posting the picture of the books in the app.

* When a picture is posted, only a student of that corresponding department is notified.

* The interested students can contact via the app and will redirect it to whatsapp or call. The student will have the access to all the content pertaining to the syllabus.
